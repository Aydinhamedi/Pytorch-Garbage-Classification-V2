A Pytorch project for garbage classification using the **EfficientNet-B6** model to achive a **95.78%** accuracy on the test set.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is a new version of the original project, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Aydinhamedi/Pytorch-Garbage-Classification) **but with a improved training process + code and a different dataset**.

## ðŸ˜‰ Bonus
This project is not hard coded for this specific dataset, so it can be used for any image classification task and it has all the necessary tools to train a model from scratch and more. **(I will make a pytorch classification template soon)**

## ðŸ“¦ Release

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Garbage Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asdasdasasdas/garbage-classification) from Kaggle. It contains images of garbage, divided into six categories.

## ðŸ§ª Model

I used the **EfficientNet-B6** model for this project. **EfficientNet-B6** is a convolutional neural network that is pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. It is known for its efficiency and high performance on a variety of image classification tasks. [Original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946)

## ðŸ”° Installation

To run the code in this repository, you will need to install the required libraries. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> [!WARNING]
> The requirements are auto generated by `pipreqs` and may not contain all the necessary dependencies. like hidden ones like Tensorboard.

## ðŸš€ Usage

The main code for this project is in a Jupyter notebook named `Main.ipynb`. To run the notebook, use the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook Main.ipynb
```
